# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Laravel 12 **API-only** starter template using Sanctum bearer-token authentication, modular monolith (InterNACHI/modular), RBAC permissions, multi-tenant hierarchy, and production-ready deployment (Docker + Octane). No Blade views, no frontend assets, no Dusk.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Full project setup
composer setup

# Start dev environment (server + queue + scheduler + logs)
composer dev

# Run tests
composer test
php artisan test --compact --filter=TestName

# Static analysis
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse

# Code formatting
./vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent

# Generate IDE helper files
composer ide-helper

# Database
php artisan migrate
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Create user via CLI
php artisan create:user              # interactive
php artisan create:user --admin      # create admin user
```

## Architecture

### Stack
- **Laravel 12** on PHP 8.2+, SQLite (dev/test), PostgreSQL (prod)
- **Sanctum API** with bearer tokens — `auth:sanctum` middleware on all protected routes
- **Modular monolith** in `app-modules/`: `core`, `user`, `auth`, `tenant`, `permission`
- All routes live in `routes/api.php` (no `routes/web.php`)

### Auth (Sanctum bearer tokens)
- `POST /api/auth/login` → `{user, token}` — manual `Hash::check`, no `Auth::attempt`, no session, no remember-me
- `POST /api/auth/register` → `{user, token}` (201)
- `POST /api/auth/logout` → revokes the current token
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` / `POST /api/auth/reset-password` — Laravel's `Password` broker
- Rate limits: `throttle:5,1` on login/register, `throttle:3,1` on password reset
- All validation in Form Request classes

### Authorization
- **RBAC** lives in `app-modules/permission`. `roles.permissions` is a JSON tree (e.g. `{"users":["create","update","delete"]}`) flattened into dotted abilities by `PermissionService` (e.g. `users.create`).
- `Gate::before` (in `PermissionServiceProvider`) short-circuits to `true` when the user holds the role permission, otherwise returns `null` so other gates/policies run.
- **Tenant-scoped abilities** (`tenants.create`, `tenants.users.view|attach|detach`, `tenants.settings.view|update|delete`) are defined in `TenantServiceProvider::boot()` via `Gate::define` and require the user to be a member of the target tenant.
- **Policies:** `TenantPolicy` (view/update/delete/restore) and `UserPolicy` (blocks acting on self) registered in their module providers.

### Multi-tenant
- Tenants form a hierarchy via `parent_id` with soft delete; users link via the `tenant_user` pivot.
- The current tenant is resolved from the `X-Tenant-ID` request header by the `tenant` middleware (`SetCurrentTenant`), which is registered as a route alias inside `TenantServiceProvider::boot()`.
- `Tenant::current()` is backed by the `CurrentTenantManager` (registered as `scoped` for Octane safety) — request-only, no session.

### Database Schema
- `users`: name, email, password, email_verified_at, remember_token (Laravel scaffolding; unused for token API), timestamps. **No `role` column** — roles live in the RBAC tables.
- `roles`: name, tenant_id (nullable for global roles), permissions JSON.
- `user_roles`: pivot.
- `tenants`, `tenant_user`: hierarchy + membership.
- `password_reset_tokens`: used by Password broker.

### Deployment
- **Docker:** multi-stage Dockerfile with Octane/Swoole (`deployment/`)
- **Stack:** PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, Adminer (`deployment/stack.yaml`)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions → GHCR with optional deploy webhook (`.github/workflows/docker.yaml`)
- **Production env:** `deployment/.env.example`

### Testing
- PHPUnit with in-memory SQLite, array cache driver
- Test suites: `tests/Unit/`, `tests/Feature/`, plus `app-modules/*/tests/`
- All HTTP tests use `postJson`/`getJson`/`patchJson`/`deleteJson` and assert via `assertJsonValidationErrors` (NOT `assertSessionHas*` — there is no session)
- Use `actingAs($user, 'sanctum')` to authenticate in HTTP tests
- Use `UserFactory::admin()` to attach the global admin role

## Tooling Policy — Use Serena MCP for ALL code operations

This project blocks the built-in `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Grep`, `Glob` tools via `permissions.deny` in `.claude/settings.json`. **Every file operation must go through Serena MCP**:

| Built-in (denied) | Use Serena instead |
|---|---|
| `Read` | `mcp__plugin_serena_serena__read_file` |
| `Write` | `mcp__plugin_serena_serena__create_text_file` |
| `Edit` (small change) | `mcp__plugin_serena_serena__replace_content` |
| `Edit` (symbol body) | `mcp__plugin_serena_serena__replace_symbol_body` |
| `Edit` (insert before/after symbol) | `mcp__plugin_serena_serena__insert_before_symbol` / `insert_after_symbol` |
| `Grep` | `mcp__plugin_serena_serena__search_for_pattern` |
| `Glob` / file lookup | `mcp__plugin_serena_serena__find_file` / `list_dir` |
| Code structure overview | `mcp__plugin_serena_serena__get_symbols_overview` / `find_symbol` |
| LSP diagnostics | `mcp__plugin_serena_serena__get_diagnostics_for_file` |

This forces symbolic, token-efficient reads (no whole-file slurps unless necessary) and consistent diagnostics access. The PostToolUse hook in `.claude/settings.json` runs PHPStan automatically after every Serena edit on `.php` files inside `app-modules/` or `app/` (skipping tests/migrations) — diagnostics return inline in the agent context.

## Conventions

- API-only: every controller returns `JsonResponse`
- Resource controllers follow Laravel conventions; routes named with dot-case (`tenant.settings.show`)
- PHP 8.2+ features: constructor property promotion, typed properties, return types
- Code style: Laravel Pint (PSR-12)
- `CoreServiceProvider` regenerates IDE helper files after migrations in local environment
- Flash messages do NOT exist — return JSON with appropriate status codes

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.4
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/octane (OCTANE) - v2
- laravel/sanctum (SANCTUM) - v4
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- larastan/larastan (LARASTAN) - v3
- laravel/boost (BOOST) - v2
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pail (PAIL) - v1
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v11

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan Commands

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`, `php artisan tinker --execute "..."`).
- Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Debugging

- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.
- Use the `database-schema` tool to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- To execute PHP code for debugging, run `php artisan tinker --execute "your code here"` directly.
- To read configuration values, read the config files directly or run `php artisan config:show [key]`.
- To inspect routes, run `php artisan route:list` directly.
- To check environment variables, read the `.env` file directly.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before trying other approaches when working with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. The most relevant results will be returned first.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.

## Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

## Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<!-- Explicit Return Types and Method Params -->
```php
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
```

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless the logic is exceptionally complex.

## PHPDoc Blocks

- Add useful array shape type definitions when appropriate.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

## Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

## Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

## Laravel 12 Structure

- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app/Console/Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== octane/core rules ===

# Octane

- Octane boots the application once and reuses it across requests, so singletons persist between requests.
- The Laravel container's `scoped` method may be used as a safe alternative to `singleton`.
- Never inject the container, request, or config repository into a singleton's constructor; use a resolver closure or `bind()` instead:

```php
// Bad
$this->app->singleton(Service::class, fn (Application $app) => new Service($app['request']));

// Good
$this->app->singleton(Service::class, fn () => new Service(fn () => request()));
```

- Never append to static properties, as they accumulate in memory across requests.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== phpunit/core rules ===

# PHPUnit

- This application uses PHPUnit for testing. All tests must be written as PHPUnit classes. Use `php artisan make:test --phpunit {name}` to create a new test.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When the tests relating to your feature are passing, ask the user if they would like to also run the entire test suite to make sure everything is still passing.
- Tests should cover all happy paths, failure paths, and edge cases.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files; these are core to the application.

## Running Tests

- Run the minimal number of tests, using an appropriate filter, before finalizing.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test --compact`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).
